				        	Crisis is an emergency situation in everyone’s life which causes embarrassment.<br>
							Crisis can be categorized into two types:<br>
							<ol class="grid_7">
								<li>Avoidable crisis: It is caused due to habit/personality traits, bad manners, addiction, Deferring and avoidance of responsibilities.</li>
								<li>Unavoidable crisis: It is caused due to limitation of knowledge and ability.</li>
							</ol>
							
							
							In Crisis we get depressed which leads to loss of efficiency and effectiveness. In turn this depression causes fear and stress.<br><br>
							What will be taught in this session? :<br>
							<ul id="myList" class="grid_7">
								<li>How and why to change attitude to handle real life situations?</li>

				        <div class="grid_7 text_6">
				        	<br>
				        	Stress is a very common event and experience in every one’s life. According to a recent study, almost 90% people experience high levels of stress.  Not only it is today’s No.1 Killer in the world but also causes tremendous loss in terms of productivity, money and creativity.<br><br>
							When capacity is less than demand leads to stress.<br>
							Stress = capacity < demand<br><br>
							The causes of stress are internal and external like:<br>
							<ul id="myList" class="grid_7">
								<li>Illness</li>
								<li>Personality traits</li>
								<li>Environmental factors</li>
								<li>Daily hassles</li>
								<li>Social interaction</li>
								<li>Events</li>
							</ul>
							<br>
							Stress is part of our body’s natural response of “fight or flight” to protect ourselves from external factors.<br>
							In olden days, stress was short lasting which allowed a human to grow and survive but now-a-days stress is a long lasting or even a continuous process, which results in detrimental effect on body and mind. Stress then manifests into acute/chronic diseases and eventually leads to death.<br><br>
							
							There have been many methods of relief and adaptation from stressful situations. These methods are not that effective to handle such immense stress. In fact, Stress is still rising especially amongst youngsters in the name of competition and success.<br><br>
							
							In Yoga, there is a holistic approach which takes into account of every dimension of human personality like physical, pranic (vital energy), manasic (Psychological), intellectual, social and above all spiritual. This helps man attain bliss (Ananda / happiness).<br><br>
							
							These yogic learnings will attempt to arm you with the most powerful anti-stress weapon known to man … “Ananda”<br><br>

				        <h6 class="text_2 color_4 header_2"><a href="#">Can Relaxation and study go together?:</a></h6>
				        <div class="grid_7 text_6">
				        <br>
				        	There are many world famous people who have excelled in different fields but they didn’t have higher education or even failed in few examinations.<br>
				        	For example, Albert Einstein, Thomas Alva Edison, Sir Winston Churchill, Sachin Tendulkar etc. Exams are standardized so much that it is not anymore a measure of student’s ability because a student might be good at few and bad in other subjects.<br>
				        	<br>
							A student’s success in exams is determined based on his/her luck. Let see the following statistics in the below pie chart:<br>
							<br>
				        	<img alt="Study and exams" src="images/Study.jpg">
				        	<br>
				        	<br>
				        	If a student understands the concepts in a subject then retention is easy which in turn his/her answers and overall performance becomes effective.<br>
				        	 <br>
							There are three stages for attending any exam. Every student can succeed if he/she effectively implements the below steps:<br>
							<ol class="grid_7">
								<li>Collection of information</li>
								<li>Retention of information</li>
								<li>Recollection of information</li>
								<br>
							</ol>
							
							Effectiveness of the above stages can be improved by yogic techniques.<br>
							<br>
							Requirement of examination are self-confidence, will power, memory, concentration, clarity and understanding which can be improved with the help of yogic techniques like:
							<br> 
							
							<ol id="myList" class="grid_7">
								<li>Trataka</li>
								<li>Palming</li>
								<li>Visualization</li>
								<li>Vikendrikaran</li>
								<li>Asana</li>
								<li>Pranayama</li>
								<li>Meditation</li>
								<br>
							</ol>
							
							<br>For guaranteed success, human tendency is to take less demanding ventures. It results in underutilizing our real potential ultimately causing loss of confidence. For such a problem, there is a special yogic technique called “Sankalpa Shakti” which actually goes around experimenting the “sankalpa” (resolution) power in a student.<br>

				        <h6 class="text_2 color_4 header_2"><a href="#">Self Management:</a></h6>
				        <div class="grid_7 text_6">
				        	<br>
				            In today's world, everyone enters into a rat race to succeed in life and this instils a fear of failure in us, consequently does not let us take up any challenging responsibilities. In order to succeed in this rat race, we need to possess “self-management”. We should never be over-confident or have ego because there are always external factors that could hinder our plans.<br>
				            <br>
							The secret of happy life is to learn the art of desire management.  Desires are always endless. Unfulfilled desires lead to sadness and depression which ultimately leads to anger. We are stuck in this endless loop. In order to come out of this circle, we need knowledge and yogic techniques.<br>
							<br>

				        <div class="grid_7 text_6">
				        	<br>
				            Desire management is necessary because even a successful person is frustrated has many unfulfilled and suppressed desires. By fulfilling desires we feel satisfied, relaxed, relieved and at peace.<br>
				            <br>
							“Daridrata” is the feeling of possessing less than what we need. People are Sadhan sampanna daridri or Sadhan vihin daridri. Samaruddhata is a feeling of possessing more than the need. Desire is the urge and not the object we crave for. Urge is a power which can either motivate or disturb you. In desire senses become outward and person develops anxiety and gets disturbed.<br>
							<br>
							 By yogic technique one can calm down the body, defilements and mind and evolve spiritually. Increase your knowledge, and use it to overcome your anger and LIVE HAPPILY.<br>
							<br>
							People are categorized into two types based on mentality. They are:<br>
							
							<ol class="grid_8">
								<li>Daridri
									<ul>
										<li>1. &nbspSadhan Vihin Daridri - A person who has less than he needs</li>
										<li>2. &nbspSadhan Sampanna Daridri - A person who has more than what he needs but still he feels that he possesses less</li>
									</ul>
								<li>Samruddha</li>

				        <div class="grid_7 text_6">
				        	<br>
				            When we have an attachment with things/people, then on losing them creates a feeling of emptiness, sadness, grief which in turn magnifies into suffering and depression.<br>
				            <br>
							Now let’s see, a child is happy with himself but society wants to use that child for their benefits in future. It won’t be possible unless the child has attachment with society, institution, parents etc. Hence they “mould” the mindset of a happy child such that his thoughts and actions are “bounded” by caste, race, religion, relationships etc. This thought process makes him to virtually divide the things and the people around him. This division in turn leads to conflicts. These conflicts leads to suffering anguish and sorrow.<br><br>

				            Every day we have to do various types of work. Our daily hassles includes physical and physiological difficulties like spasms, aching, stiffness, back-pain, general fatigue, feeling “low” which causes mental strain.<br>

								<div class="text_2 color_3 wrap_21">Improvement of sixth sense:</div>
								<div class="grid_7">
									We experience the world with the help of our five sense organs those are namely Eyes, ears, nose, Skin, and tongue. Mind analyses these experiences and then correlates it with previous experiences. During to this process, some understanding is developed which determines how we perceive the experience either as good or bad.<br>
									<br>
									In either of the cases our mind gets involved in planning about how to retain or achieve the good experience and how to get rid of bad experience/situation. These understandings prejudice us to consider the experience to be good or bad making us a conditioned person.<br><br> 
									For Example, when we look at cow some people may consider it as god, some people may perceive as an object to be eaten. So object is same but the perception is different because of our conditioning.<br>
									Developing the sixth sense helps us free ourselves from the clutches of five senses as well as the related prejudice which is created because of the previous experiences.<br><br>
									In our workshops, most of the people can experience the sixth sense in the very first session. One can practice and become the master of sixth sense which can help a person to take right decisions at the right time.<br>

									<br>
									With the help of yogic games, a person can come out of restlessness and gets established in the given task happily.<br>
									<br>
									For example, a 10-year old child who usually can’t concentrate on a given task even for 10 minutes can remain fully involved in a task for more than an hour. This can be done by practicing for 5 days!!!<br>

									Why is it Called Laughter Yoga?<br>
									This has a powerful and immediate effect on our physiology and has been used for more than four thousand years to influence the body, mind and emotions. According to yogic philosophy, we are alive because the cosmic energy from the universe flows into our body through our breath which is the life energy force or “PRANA”.<br> 
									The very essence of our life is breathing. Due to stress and negative emotions, our breathing becomes irregular and shallow, thus affecting the flow of Prana through our body.<br>

									<br>
									Happiness is everything and it was a state of mind. You can’t do anything if you are not happy. Other way if you are happy, you can do anything on the planet.<br>
									Happiness is an important part of our life – no less than anger, sadness, and fear. It begins with life itself. What happens to mother if she doesn’t recognize the look of happiness on the face of her newborn? Human-beings are wired with innate, neurological potential for happiness, but whether this potential eventually becomes a reality depends on how we choose to live our lives. In other words happiness isn’t an accident and it isn’t a gift from the gods – it’s the gift you give yourself.<br> 
									Simple formulas to be in the state of eternal happiness:<br>

									<ul id="myList" class="grid_7">
										<li>Establish a vibrant morning rituals and Take a decision to be happy come what may</li>
										<li>It can produce anti-inflammatory agents, which can avoid back pain or arthritis</li>
										<li>Eat a healthy Diet with full of sprouts, Vegetables and fruits</li>
										<li>Practice regular exercise – Jogging, Yoga, Pranayama</li>
										<li>Get enough sleep - Sleep early – Wake up early</li>
										<li>Make a spiritual connection and understand the cosmic power</li>
										<li>Develop the attitude of gratitude</li>
										<li>Think and feel with compassion</li>
										<li>Lend a helping hand</li>
										<li>Keep smiling and Laugh whole-heartedly</li>
										<li>Meditate morning and night</li>
