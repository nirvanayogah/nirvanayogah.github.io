					                    "Yoga, I enjoyed it many times even with some body pains. I enjoyed it because I learnt something new and I corrected some of my mistakes whch I was commiting while practicing. 
					                    I was very confused with shavasana before. But now at last I got a clarity what to do.Suryanamaskara is like best part. The kriyas which we did were very interesting and challenging too. 
										The sitting aasanas are very useful for everyone especially me. Supine experience and helpful for stretching of muscles and get some refreshment.
										Breathing exercises are very helpful for me as I have some breathing problem and my mother always wanted me to learn.
										It made me wake up early in the morning. At last I learnt by this way. I didn’t miss the peaceful sunrise. Completely. It helped me a lot and even I enjoyed few things very much."

										As this is just a day course, I know that we have barely scratched at the ice berg of knowledge about yoga. I am also  ready to learn more about this wonderful lifestyle."
