				        	Modern style of living have given comforts, but in the meantime it has its darker side too. There is increasing prevalence of many metabolic disorders, lifestyle diseases, Obesity, Diabetes, Hypertension, etc.  This continuously changing, technologically advanced, and competitive environment causes stress and diseases like diabetes in humans.<br> 
							In spite of advance care and management, diabetes mellitus continues to be an important public health concern, causing morbidity and mortality and long- term complications. Although there is lot of awareness in the rise of diabetics in the world, however the treatment is restricted to intake of drugs and suggesting to adopt a healthy lifestyle. <br>
							There are references of diabetes in our ancient Āyurvedic scriptures. In our ancient texts, Diabetes is a systemic disease caused by imbalance in the dośas and recognition and correction of these imbalances at the earlier stage can pave a way for prevention strategies. Ancient Āyurvedic texts, describes the drugs used for diabetes and the principle behind holistic approach in treatment of diabetes.<br>  
							1.1.1 What is Diabetes Mellitus?<b>
							
							Diabetes mellitus represents a group of diseases of heterogeneous etiology, characterized by chronic hyperglycemia and other metabolic abnormalities, which are due to deficiency of insulin effect (Kuzuya T, et al., 2002). After a long duration of metabolic derangement, specific complications of diabetes (retinopathy, nephropathy, and neuropathy) may occur. As per metabolic abnormality, diabetes may be a symptomatic, or may be associated with symptoms like thirst, and weight loss, or may progress to ketoacidosis and coma.<br>
							
							1.2.4 Concept of health and yoga: Health and ill-health are not two discrete entities as commonly understood but health is a continuous function indicating the state of well-being. According to the World Health Organization (WHO) the state of Health is defined as a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being and not merely an absence of disease. WHO also suggests a fourth dimension of spiritual well-being.<br>

							In the diagram, the 3 quadrant 'the region of ill- health' normally we called it as 'Sickness'. Below this, man acts instinctively and is similar to animal man. The first quadrant, is the region of 'Normal health'. As he moves further up, he becomes healthier by the dormant faculties expressing more intensely in him. This is the region of Super Man. In this state, the limitations of normal man like strong urges of thirst, hunger, fear and sex are reduced greatly and are fully under control.<br>
							Yoga is for overall personality development on physical, mental, emotional, intellectual and spiritual level of a man. It is a conscious process for accelerating the growth of a human being from his animal level to divinity. It includes techniques useful for therapeutic applications in making man healthier. Yoga can be used as preventive measure, as a treatment or for rehabilitation in various diseases. Yoga is a process for elevating oneself by calming down the mind.<br>
							
							1.2.5 Yoga therapy<br>
							Yoga therapy consist of various techniques by which one can correct the problem from the fundamental level. The corrections are done on innermost, causal layer of our existence that at the Änandamaya Kosha or the soul or the master of the system. Correction of bodily disturbances are done by correcting the emotional, psychological and the vital energy levels. The several techniques of integrated approach are use to  reach the state of total silence or calmness of mind or deep relaxation and rest.<br>
							Yoga turns the mind inwards and achieves deep awareness, its a functions of internal organs. Internal awareness helps to solve one's own internal psychological and emotional conflicts as in psychotherapy. Like behavior therapy, this internal awareness helps to change the learnt conditioning.  It also  helps in changing the pattern of psychological and physiological responses towards the situation. Like hypnotherapy yoga is a technique to manifest the divinity within, so as to opened up the dormant capabilities and alter his own physiology with the help of simple suggestions. Through yoga one does it consciously by mastering the states of consciousness. Through conscious, slow, rhythmic breathing yoga corrects the flow of Prana, by slowing down the Pränic activity gently and cautiously. Yogasanas increase local relaxation and improves tolerance on physical level. Similar to desensitization therapy for allergens, Kriyas helps in developing tolerance to external agents. According to  traditional yogic texts the  psychological disturbances leads  to somatic problems.<br>
							Yoga Vasishtha described it as, when the mind is agitated during our interactions with the world these disturbances of the mind (Manomaya kosha) percolates into the physical body (Annamaya Kosha) through the vital energy body<br>
							Img Diabetes 1.jpg<br>
							
							
							 
							(Pranamaya kosha), the physical body also follows in its wake. Because of these agitations a violent fluctuations is cause in the flow of vital energy (Prana) in its channels called Nädis, and Prana flows in wrong paths  without rhythm and harmony. In this condition Nädis can not maintain stability and steadiness, but quiver. Because of these disturbances in the Prana and unsteadiness in the Nadis, the food does not get properly digested. It leads to wrong digestion (Kujereernatvam), non-digestion (Ajeernatvam) and over-digestion (Atijeernatvam). Because of such improperly digested food settles down in the body amidst such turmoils, leads to psychosomatic type of ailments, called Ädhijä Vyädhis.  To bring a  quick results in the treatment of this type of psychosomatic ailments it is necessary to work at all levels of existence. The integrated approach thus, uses techniques to operate not only on just physical aspect of the problem but on all aspects of our existence. Large number of Yogic practices are available in the texts of Yoga and Upanishads to tackle this set of complex psychosomatic ailments, and harmonize the disturbances at each of the levels.<br>
							
							1.3 The Five aspects of human existence:<br>
							
							Diabetes2.jpg<br>
							
							Source: Study material of MSC. Yoga therapy (Yoga philosophy and health)<br>
							
							1.3.1 Practices at Physical level (Annamaya Kosha Practices)<br>
							These practices consist of education on healthy yogic diet for diabetics, loosening exercises, asanas or postures done with awareness, Kriyas and  relaxation techniques like; instant relaxation technique (IRT) and quick relaxation technique (QRT) and deep relaxation technique (DRT). They are used to operate at the Annamaya Kosha level, to remove the physical symptoms of the ailments.<br>
							<br>
							1.3.2 Practices of vital energy level (Pranamaya Kosha practices) Prana is the basic life principle and pranayama is a process for gaining control over Prana. In illnesses Prana is abnormal. With the help of proper breathing, Kriyäs and pranayama, these imbalances at the Pränämayä Kosha are corrected. Ailments are handled at this pranayama Kosha level by suitable types of pranayama and breathing which help to remove the agitations in Pranaic flows in the pranayama Kosha.<br>  
							1.3.3 Practices at mind level (Manomaya Kosha): In Manomaya Kosha different meditation techniques as described in last three limbs of Ashtanga Yoga of Patanjali i.e. Dharana, Dhyäna and Samädhi are used.<br>
							It cultures the mind by focussing of the mind (Dhäranä), followed by relaxed dwelling of mind on a single thought (Dhyana) for longer durations, it further  ultimately leads to super-consciousness (Samadhi).<br>
							It allows the mind to remain relaxed during the period of meditation (Dhyana ). In bhakti yoga there are various techniques, they help in controlling our emotions. These techniques like devotional sessions, prayers, chants, bhajans, namavalis, dhuns, stotras etc.,  help to build a congenial atmosphere to recognize, evoke,  attenuate and  vanish the emotions. In Bhakti yoga control on emotions is achived through the path of divine love. The emotional imbalances and upsurges are eliminated by such control.<br>
							
							1.3.4 Practices at intellect level (Vijnanamaya Kosha): A proper understanding is the key to operate from Vijnanamaya Kosha. Upanishads are full of such knowledge which helps to rescue from all miseries and obsession. Lack of that Jnäna which is responsible for many wrong habits, agitations, etc. Taittiréya Upanishat through Happiness Analysis - (Änanda Mimämsa) handles the most fundamental problem relevant to all living creatures. It helps the person to change his attitude of greed and deep attachment to material possessions and enjoyments. The realization that happiness is within  'in each one of us' in our causal state removes all doubts, clears the mind and stabilizes the body. Because of Knowledge man's outlook gets changes and further it burns the basic reasons for the agitations of mind like strong attachments, obsessions, likes and dislikes.<br>
							1.3.5 Practices at bliss level (Anandamaya kosha): True nature of human is bliss. Ones the man establishes in this blissful body; becomes free from illnesses. Result oriented modern life style posing the problems of stress. Psychological corrections help in the practice of "action in relaxation" or "action in blissful awareness" which are essential for a stress free state. In karma yoga there are various  techniques of dis-identifying ourselves from the ups and downs of the life and that helps us to remain in inner blissful state.  <br>
